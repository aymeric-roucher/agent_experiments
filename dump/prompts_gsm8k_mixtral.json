He also has one less parrot than cats, or (c-1) parrots.\n\nWe know that the total number of pets that have four legs is six, which includes the dogs. Dogs have four legs, so Frankie has two dogs and four more pets with four legs. These four pets could be a combination of cats and snakes, since they also have four legs.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine exactly how many cats, snakes, and parrots Frankie has. Therefore, we cannot give a specific answer to the total number of pets Frankie has.

She spends $8 each day for 7 days, so she spends a total of $8 * 7 = $56.\n\nNow, we know that Emma's bank account has $100 in it, and she withdraws all but $5 bills. So, we need to figure out how many $5 bills she can withdraw. To do this, we divide her remaining balance by 5. \n\n$100 - $56 = $44, and $44 / $5 = 8.8. Since she can't have a fraction of a bill, she takes out 8 bills, leaving her with $44 - (8 * $5) = $44 - $40 = $4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that $4 remains in the account.", "4": " To find out how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we need to find the distance of the hike he didn't cover in the first two days. \n\nOn the first day, he hiked 10 kilometers.

Since James collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, and he needs to collect 500 - (50 + 150 + 100) = 200 tins more, he must collect 200 / 4 = 50 tins on each of the remaining 4 days.\n\nThe answer is that James collects 50 tins on the first day, 150 tins on the second day, 100 tins on the third day, and 50 tins on each of the remaining four days.", "6": " First, we know that one of the darts hit the bullseye, which is worth 50 points. \n\nThe second dart missed the target entirely, so it scored 0 points.\n\nThe third dart was worth half the points of the bullseye.

Pebbles create a splash 1/4 meter wide. TreQuan tosses 6 pebbles, so the total width of the pebble splashes is (1/4 meter/pebble * 6 pebbles = 6/4 meters, or 1.5 meters).\n2. Rocks create a splash 1/2 meter wide. TreQuan tosses 3 rocks, so the total width of the rock splashes is (1/2 meter/rock * 3 rocks = 3/2 meters, or 1.5 meters).\n3. Boulders create a splash 2 meters wide. TreQuan tosses 2 boulders, so the total width of the boulder splashes is (2 meters/boulder * 2 boulders = 4 meters).\n\nNow, we add up the widths of all the splashes to find the total width:\n\n1.5 meters (pebbles) + 1.5 meters (rocks) + 4 meters (boulders) = 7 meters\n\nSo, TreQuan makes a total width of 7 meters of splashes.", "8": " 1.

So, the number of cards Robert traded is 8 + 15 = 23.\n\nNow, to find the total number of cards traded between both Padma and Robert, we add the number of cards each of them traded: 12 (Padma's traded cards) + 23 (Robert's traded cards) = 35.\n\nSo the answer is 35.0.", "29": " First, we need to find out how many gates Jason's car will have to pass through. Since there is one gate every 3 floors, and there are 12 floors, Jason's car will pass through 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 gates.\n\nEach gate takes 2 minutes, or 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds to pass through.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive from one floor to the next. This is 800 feet at 10 feet/second. To find out how long it takes, we divide the distance by the speed: 800 / 10 = <<800/10=80>>80 seconds.\n\nSince there are 11 floors between the top and bottom floors (excluding the bottom floor), Jason's car will take 11 x 80 = <<11*80=880>>880 seconds to drive between all of them.\n\nFinally, we add the time spent passing through the gates (120 x 4 = <<120*4=480>>480 seconds) to the time spent driving between the floors (880 seconds).\n\nSo the answer is 480 + 880 = <<480+880=1360>>1360 seconds."}, "score": 0.7}, "langchain_agent": {"prompt": "Cf source file", "answers": "cf other experiment", "score": 0.73}, "best_prompt": {"prompt": "\n\nQ: Consider the following math problem and solve it step by step.

Six of his pets have four legs, which means they are probably the dogs and cats (but we don't know their exact number yet).\n4. Frankie has 2 dogs.\n\nWe need to find out how many cats and snakes Frankie has, as well as how many parrots. Let's start with cats and snakes since we know there's a simple relationship between them.\n\nSince S = C + 6, and Frankie has 2 dogs which are part of the 'C' category (cats), we can say that the number of snakes is equal to the number of cats plus 6, minus 2 (the dogs). So, S = C + 4.\n\nHowever, this information isn't sufficient to determine the exact number of cats and snakes because we don't know their individual numbers. But we do know that six of his pets have four legs. The only animals we know with certainty to have four legs are the dogs, and since there are 2 dogs, that leaves 4 pets with four legs unaccounted for. These remaining four-legged pets must be cats because parrots don't have legs, and snakes have no legs either.\n\nSo now we know that Frankie has 4 cats (the ones that aren't dogs). Using the relationship S = C + 4, we can find out that Frankie has 8 snakes (4 + 4 = 8).\n\nNow we can count the total number of pets: 4 cats, 8 snakes, 2 dogs, and 0 parrots (because none were accounted for).\n\nThe answer is 14. Frankie has 14 pets in total.", "2": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1. Olaf initially has 150 toy cars.\n2.

We know that she spends $8 each day for 7 days, so:\n$56 = $8 * 7\n\nStep 2: Determine how much money Emma has left in her account after spending that amount. To do this, subtract the total amount she spent from the initial balance:\n$100 - $56 = $44\n\nStep 3: Notice that the problem states that Emma withdraws as many $5 bills as possible. Since she has $44 remaining, she can withdraw 4 $5 bills ($40) and will have $4 left in her account.\n\nThe answer is $4. After spending $56 during the week and withdrawing as many $5 bills as her account can give her, Emma is left with $4 in her bank account.", "4": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1.

He collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week.\n\nNow let's calculate the number of tins James collects on the second and third days:\n\n1. On the second day, James collects 3 * 50 = 150 tins.\n2. On the third day, James collects 150 - 50 = 100 tins.\n\nSince James collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days (fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh), we need to find out how many tins are left to be collected in the week:\n\n1. 50 (first day) + 150 (second day) + 100 (third day) = 300 tins\n2. So, he needs to collect 500 - 300 = 200 tins more in the remaining 4 days.\n3.

The width of the splash depends on the size of the rock (pebble, rock, or boulder).\n\nReasoning process:\n1. First, we need to calculate the total width created by the pebbles, rocks, and boulders separately.\n2. For the pebbles: Since there are six pebbles and each one creates a splash of 1/4 meter wide, we multiply the number of pebbles by the width of each splash: 6 pebbles * (1/4 meter/pebble) = 1.5 meters.\n3. For the rocks: Since there are three rocks and each one creates a splash of 1/2 a meter wide, we multiply the number of rocks by the width of each splash: 3 rocks * (1/2 meter/rock) = 1.5 meters.\n4. For the boulders: Since there are two boulders and each one creates a splash of 2 meters wide, we multiply the number of boulders by the width of each splash: 2 boulders * (2 meters/boulder) = 4 meters.\n5. Finally, we add up the total widths created by the pebbles, rocks, and boulders: 1.5 meters (pebbles) + 1.5 meters (rocks) + 4 meters (boulders) = 7 meters.\n\nThe answer is that the total width of the splashes TreQuan makes is 7 meters.", "8": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1.

To do this, we'll first determine the number of children's books, then add that to the number of adult books.\n\nStep 1: Find the number of children's books\nSince 35% of the books are for children, we can represent the total number of books as x. So, the number of children's books is 0.35x.\n\nStep 2: Combine the number of children's and adult books\nWe know that there are 104 books for adults, so we can write the equation:\nx = 0.35x + 104\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.35x from both sides:\n0.65x = 104\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.65 to get x:\nx / 0.65 = 104 / 0.65\nx \u2248 160\n\nSo, there are approximately 160 books in the library.\n\nThe answer is 160.", "12": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1.

The number of Fords Jim has is 3 less than half the number of Chevys he has.\n\nLet's break down this problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: First, let's use variables to represent the number of each type of car:\nB = number of Buicks\nF = number of Fords\nC = number of Chevys\n\nStep 2: According to the given information, we can write two equations based on relationships 2 and 3:\nB = 4F\nF = (C - 3) / 2\n\nStep 3: We also know that the total number of cars is 301, so we can write another equation for the total:\nB + F + C = 301\n\nStep 4: Now, substitute the expressions from steps 2 into the total equation from step 3:\n4F + F + (C - 3) / 2 = 301\n\nStep 5: To solve for C, first multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n8F + 2F + C - 3 = 602\n10F + C = 605\n\nStep 6: Ideally, we would like to have only one variable in the equation. Since B = 4F, let's substitute B back into the equation:\n10(B/4) + B = 605\n2.5B + B = 605\n3.5B = 605\n\nStep 7: Now, divide both sides by 3.5 to solve for B:\nB = 605 / 3.5\nB = 173 (approximately)\n\nStep 8: Since B represents the number of Buicks, and we found B to be approximately 173, we can conclude:\n\nThe answer is 173.\n\nJim has approximately 173 Buick model cars.", "24": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1. Peter's goal for the vacation is $5,00", "25": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1. Wendy spent 25 years as an accountant.\n2. Wendy spent 15 years as an accounting manager.\n3. The total time spent on accounting-related jobs is 25 + 15 = 40 years.\n4. Wendy lived to be 80 years old.\n\nWe need to find the percentage of Wendy's life spent in an accounting-related job. To do this, we will divide the total number of years spent on accounting-related jobs by her total lifespan, and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Calculate the total number of years Wendy spent on accounting-related jobs: 40 years\n2. Calculate her total lifespan: 80 years\n3. Divide the total number of years spent on accounting-related jobs by her total lifespan: 40 / 80 = 0.5\n4. Multiply the result by 100 to get a percentage: 0.5 * 100 = 50%\n\nThe answer is that Wendy spent 50% of her life in an accounting-related job.", "26": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1. Last year, Peter organized a Fun Run and 200 people signed up.\n2. Forty people did not show up to run last year.\n3. This year, there will be twice as many runners as last year (but this includes both those who sign up and those who actually participate).\n\nLogical reasoning and arithmetic operations:\n\nStep 1: Identify the number of people who actually ran last year. Since 40 people did not show up, this means that 200 - 40 = 160 people participated in the run last year.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of runners for this year. This year, there will be twice as many runners as last year, so we multiply the number of participants from last year by 2: 160 * 2 = 320.\n\nFinal answer: The answer is 320. This year, there will be 320 people running in Peter's Fun Run.", "27": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1. There are eight orange trees on Dulce's father's farm.\n2. Each tree has 200 fruits.\n3. Dulce picks 2/5 of the oranges from each tree.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many oranges Dulce picks from one tree. We know that she picks 2/5 of the oranges, and there are 200 oranges on each tree. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of oranges picked by Dulce from one tree:\nOranges picked by Dulce from one tree = (Number of oranges per tree) * (Fraction picked by Dulce)\n= 200 * 2/5\n= 40 oranges\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of oranges picked by Dulce from all eight trees.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of oranges picked by Dulce from all the trees:\nTotal oranges picked by Dulce = (Oranges picked per tree) * (Number of trees)\n= 40 * 8\n= 320 oranges\n\nNow, we need to find out how many oranges are remaining on all the trees after Dulce has picked some.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of oranges remaining on all the trees:\nTotal oranges remaining = (Initial number of oranges) - (Total oranges picked by Dulce)\n= (Oranges per tree * Number of trees) - (Total oranges picked by Dulce)\n= (200 * 8) - 320\n= 1600 - 320\n= 1280 oranges\n\nThe answer is that there are 1280 oranges remaining on all the trees after Dulce has picked some.", "28": " Given quantities and relationships:\n1.

Every 3rd floor has a gate that requires drivers to show ID, taking two minutes (120 seconds) per stop.\n3. To travel from one floor to the next, drivers need to drive 800 feet.\n4. The traveling speed is 10 feet per second.\n\nTo solve this problem, we first need to determine how many ID stops there are in the garage and calculate the total time spent on these stops. Then, we will calculate the time it takes to travel between floors and multiply it by the number of floor transitions. Finally, we will add the time spent on ID stops and the time spent traveling between floors to get the final answer.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of ID stops.\nNumber of ID stops = Total floors / 3\nNumber of ID stops = 12 floors / 3\nNumber of ID stops = 4\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total time spent on ID stops.\nTotal time for ID stops = Number of ID stops * Time per stop\nTotal time for ID stops = 4 * 120 seconds\nTotal time for ID stops = 480 seconds\n\nStep 3: Calculate the time it takes to travel between floors.\nTime per floor transition = Distance / Speed\nTime per floor transition = 800 feet / 10 feet/second\nTime per floor transition = 80 seconds\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total time spent on floor transitions.\nTotal time for floor transitions = Number of floors - 1 * Time per floor transition\nTotal time for floor transitions = 12 floors - 1 * 80 seconds\nTotal time for floor transitions = 11 * 80 seconds\nTotal time for floor transitions = 880 seconds\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total time spent going from the top floor to the bottom floor.\nTotal time = Total time for ID stops + Total time for floor transitions\nTotal time = 480 seconds + 880 seconds\nTotal time = 1360 seconds\n\nThe answer is 1360 seconds. It takes 1360 seconds (or approximately 22 minutes and 40 seconds) for drivers to get to the bottom of the garage from the top."}, "score": 0.6666666666666666}}
